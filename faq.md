Your Questions Answered
=======================

### What is this site?

A collection of recipes, except without any clutter. This site
has no ratings, no life stories, no reviews, no "share" buttons - just 
how to make your fucking food. We have both relatives and memories. 
That's all you get to know - [now on to the pot roast.](/r/beef-lentil-roast.md)


### Why?

In the long, long ago of maybe 2005 or so, recipe websites actually
had, well, recipes on them. Nowadays, recipe websites have lengthy
Epic Poems, detailing the lives and adventures of Norse Goddesses who
brought down sacred recipes from Mount Olympus for the mortals to
prepare and feast upon. (Yes I'm mixing mythologies and IDGAF.)

What happened, is Google decided to tweak The Algorithm(tm). Content
that is largely duplicating something else gets heavily penalized. Since
recipes are largely the same for a specific dish, everyone's PageRank
got their asses handed to them unless they added a cubic assload of
fluff.

Ain't nobody got time for that.

This site will almost certainly get dropped out of search results, and,
cool. I want a place to find something to do for dinner, and I don't 
really care if anyone else uses it.


### How can I add a recipe?

This website is static. 
[Fork it on Github](https://github.com/sparked435/tldrcooking) and send 
me a pull request.


### How can I remove a recipe?

Cool.


### How can I share a recipe on some viral mind-rot social media network?

Copy and paste the URL.


### How can I save a recipe I like to find it later?

In ye olden dayse, browsers had this feature called "bookmarks." Now
get off my lawn.
